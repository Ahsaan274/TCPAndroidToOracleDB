TCP Android Connection to Oracle Database
There are some oragnization those who own their own databases. Such as, Oracle DB, SQL and etc.
This will help you make a client in 'Android App' and make a request to the server. 
There are few ponts that I wan to mention. 
If you ooen this project in your android studio its ok. But you will copy paste the code. you need to see that file.
you will find a 'jdbc driver' in lib folder. You need to change your structure of your android to 'project' then you must go to app folder
then app and you will find that driver easily :).
